# DISC
A plug-and-play decoding intervention with similarity of characters for Chinese Spelling Check.

You can simply get phonetic and glyph similarities by running:
```bash
cd char-similarity-calculation
python merge.py
```

# You can also click [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1n29WeTU_3Rnu6T0rr8Vnro3UisoNsjWr?usp=sharing) to download pre-calculated .npy file.

We will release our relevant code and models later.
